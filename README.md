## Requirements
This software was developed using [Python 3.9.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/).

The software has several required Python packages. The requirements are listed in requirements.txt. To install all of the requirements at once, run the following terminal command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

For homology computations, we use the Python extension [pyCHomP2](https://pypi.org/project/pychomp2/).

## System numbers

See ```data/system_number_meanings.txt``` for a dictionary of the system integer labels to the qualitative descriptions of these systems. 

## How to create your own data
- Note something about all of the data being inside the data folders, but write instructions here for how to reproduce making it

## How to run the code for a single example
To compute a single example, run ``` single_example.py ```. 

At the top of the file, under "Global variables set by user", you can change:
- the system number,
- the number of nodes in the hidden layer of the neural network,
- the list of labeling thresholds, and
- the integer name that refers to the example.

Other variables, which we expect to be changed less frequently--such as learning rate and optimizer choice for the neural network--are specified in the ``` .txt ``` files located in the folder ```config``` and numbered by the corresponding system.

This computation will use the data located in ```data/``` and the subfolder that corresponds to the system number specified under "Global variables set by user" at the top of the file. So, if you want to run an example with your own data, you must replace the provided data with the data that you created.

## How to run an experiment
To run an experiment on the Amarel cluster, use the shell script ``` amarel_cluster_code/slurm_script_job_array.sh ```. The path in line 25 should be appropriately modified to use your username and the folder where the code of this repository is located. At the top of ``` run_experiment.py ```, under "Global variables set by user", you can change the system, the list of labeling thresholds, and repetitions per unique set of parameters. The lists of hidden layer widths for each system are specified in the txt files located in the folder ```config```.
